# Rainfall Comparison
Final Project for Data Analysis 2 with Code Kentucky

For the final project of Code Kentucky's Data Analysis Course, I utilized OpenMeteo's Historical Weather API to pull in data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast's ERA5 for 6 weeks in 2022 and 2023. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades. The 6 weeks I chose were the same 6 weeks covered by my recently purchased ACU*RITE rain gauge. I wanted to compare what my personal rain gauge's calculations to those of ERA5.
